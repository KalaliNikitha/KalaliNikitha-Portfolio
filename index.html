        <p>Sales Forecasting Models and Evaluation Metrics:</p>
        
        <h3>SARIMA Model:</h3>
        <p>Used for short-term demand forecasting, capturing seasonal trends but limited in handling volatility.</p>

        <h3>Regression Models:</h3>
        <p>Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting, Lasso, Ridge, ElasticNet, and AdaBoost were used, with Linear Regression showing the highest RÂ² score, though potentially overfitting.</p>

        <h3>Safety Stock and Reorder Threshold:</h3>
        <p>Calculated to prevent stockouts, optimizing inventory by adjusting stock levels based on sales forecasts.</p>

        <h3>Late Delivery Prediction:</h3>
        <p>Classification Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and AdaBoost were evaluated; Logistic Regression showed the best accuracy, with Random Forest and AdaBoost also performing well.</p>

        <h3>Fraud Detection Models:</h3>
        <p>Models Used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and XGBoost all achieved high accuracy, with Random Forest showing near-perfect precision.</p>

        <h3>Evaluation:</h3>
        <p>Confusion Matrix and Precision-Recall Curves helped assess model sensitivity and specificity in fraud detection.</p>

        <h3>RFM Analysis and Customer Segmentation:</h3>
        <p>Customer Segmentation: RFM analysis segmented customers by recency, frequency, and monetary value into groups like "Loyal Customers" and "Need Attention" to inform targeted engagement.</p>
