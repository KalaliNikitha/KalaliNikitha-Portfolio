            <h3 style="color: #f0f5f390;">Exploratory Data Analysis</h3>
            <p>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) plays a seminal role in examining data and serving as the very foundation for further 
                modelling efforts. The purpose of EDA is to spot patterns, trends, and relationships among the data. Afterwards, the 
                identified patterns, trends, and relationships aid the researcher to develop effective analytical strategies. The 
                exploration in this initial step helps to understand the relationship between different dimensions of the dataset and 
                make decisions regarding modeling later.</p>

        <h3 style="color: #f0f5f390;">Methodology and Metrics</h3>
        <p>We aim to describe the forecasting methods used in our study.All the models are trained and validated by 80/20 split.</p>
        <p>This section’s main goal is to list all the models that were applied before comparing the metrics that each of them produced.</p>
        <p><strong style="color: blue;">Demand Forecasting with SARIMA:</strong><br>
        The SARIMA model was applied to capture seasonal patterns in demand, supporting inventory management by predicting spikes and dips in sales.</p>
        <p><strong style="color: blue;">Sales Forecasting Models:</strong><br>
        Regression Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, K-Neighbors, XGBoost, and LightGBM provided a range of approaches, each optimized through hyperparameter tuning to forecast sales trends accurately.</p>
        <p><strong style="color: blue;">Late Delivery Prediction:</strong><br>
        Classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.) were evaluated for delivery predictions, with Random Forest and Logistic Regression showing high accuracy in distinguishing outcomes.</p>
        <p><strong style="color: blue;">Fraud Detection:</strong><br>
        Models like Random Forest and XGBoost achieved near-perfect accuracy in fraud detection, with metrics such as ROC-AUC confirming high reliability.</p>
        <p><strong style="color: blue;">Customer Segmentation with RFM Analysis:</strong><br>
        RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis categorized customers by purchasing behavior, enabling targeted engagement for different loyalty segments.</p>

            <h3 style="color: #f0f5f390;">Results and Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Sales Forecasting Models and Evaluation Metrics

                SARIMA Model: Used for short-term demand forecasting, capturing seasonal trends but limited in handling volatility.
                
                Regression Models: Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting, Lasso, Ridge, ElasticNet, and AdaBoost were used, with Linear Regression showing the highest R² score, though potentially overfitting.
                Safety Stock and Reorder Threshold: Calculated to prevent stockouts, optimizing inventory by adjusting stock levels based on sales forecasts.
                Here’s a more concise version:
                
                Late Delivery Prediction
                
                Classification Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and AdaBoost were evaluated; Logistic Regression showed the best accuracy, with Random Forest and AdaBoost also performing well.

                Fraud Detection Models
                
                Models Used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and XGBoost all achieved high accuracy, with Random Forest showing near-perfect precision.
                Evaluation: Confusion Matrix and Precision-Recall Curves helped assess model sensitivity and specificity in fraud detection.

                RFM Analysis and Customer Segmentation
                
                Customer Segmentation: RFM analysis segmented customers by recency, frequency, and monetary value into groups like "Loyal Customers" and "Need Attention" to inform targeted engagement.
